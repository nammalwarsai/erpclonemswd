# Simple Python Program: Age Calculator

# Ask for the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")

# Ask for the user's age
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# Calculate the year when the user will turn 100
years_until_100 = 100 - age

# Output a message to the user
print(f"Hello, {name}! You will turn 100 years old in {years_until_100} years.")
